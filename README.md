# Electronic labbook
As a scientist, you do experiments on the wet bench. Before starting the experiment for real, you need to prepare it to think about it. This means do some bibliography, put your research activity into a scientific context, introduce the experiment, prepare a protocol. After the experiment, you need to write somewhere what you have done (i.e your protocole), collect and centralize the results (images, files, ..), interprete the data and finally conclude about what you have done.

All these steps used to be done with paper logbooks.

You can also do them with this electronic labbook.

# This project
This is an old project based oon ruby on rails. I developed it, when I was working at the bench and it was used daily. 

It is not compatible anymore with latest rails versions. 

I am considering reviving it.
