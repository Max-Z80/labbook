is this ?</big><br>
This project is an electronic lab book, a tool which helps you to keep
traces of the experiments you have done. All you data (texts, pictures,
pdf,...) are stored on a remote server. After logged in, you access
them via whatever computer on the network with your favorite browser.<br>
